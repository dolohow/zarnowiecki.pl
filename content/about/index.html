        Hi! My name is ≈Åukasz. I am Linux and free software enthusiast and I work professionally
        as a software developer, consultant and interviewer. I also teach people how to program.
        </p>

        <p>
        I enjoy new things in life which are still plenty to explore. Training
        is important part of my life and I spent whole lot of time doing just
        that. I trained powerfling and now I mostly spent my time on bike.
        </p>

        <p>
        I stand against monopoly, vendor lock-in and I am in favour of hosting my own stuff
        when possible.
