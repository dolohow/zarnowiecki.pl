        Hi! My name is ≈Åukasz. I am Linux and free software enthusiast and I
        work professionally as a software architect, consultant and interviewer.
        I also teach people how to program and mentor them.
        </p>

        <p>
        I enjoy new things in life, which are still plenty to explore. Training
        is an important part of it.  I train Olympic Weightlifting and I enjoy
        enduro rides.
        </p>

        <p>
        Personally, I stand against monopoly, vendor lock-in and I prefer
        hosting my own stuff when possible.
